 Section 1 - Usage Overview

Section 2 - Membership vs Non-Members

/***********************************
 Section 5 - Round-Trips
***********************************/
-- Create a step by step process to get to a list of stations with 500+ trips starting from the station & 10% round trips

-- First, write a query that counts the number of starting trips per station.

FROM trips
GROUP BY start_station_code

-- Second, write a query that counts, for each station, the number of round trips.

COUNT(*) AS num_trips
FROM trips
WHERE start_station_code = end_station_code
GROUP BY start_station_code
ORDER BY num_trips DESC;

-- Combining the above queries and calculate the fraction of round trips to the total number of starting trips for each station.
